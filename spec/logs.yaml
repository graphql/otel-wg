    brief: >
      This document defines attributes for GraphQL errors represented using Log
      Records.
    note: >
      GraphQL errors can occur during various phases of request processing including
      parsing, validation, and execution. Errors should be recorded on the root
      span for simplicity and scalability. Multiple errors can be recorded as
      separate log records.

      Errors and exceptions can coexist for the same issue - errors being visible
      to users and exceptions representing unhandled issues with stack traces.
    attributes:
      - ref: graphql.error.message
        requirement_level: required
      - ref: graphql.error.locations
        requirement_level:
          conditionally_required: Should be included when the error can be associated with a specific location in the GraphQL document.
      - ref: graphql.error.path
        requirement_level:
          conditionally_required: Must be included when the error can be associated with a particular field in the GraphQL result.
      - ref: graphql.error.code
        requirement_level: opt_in
      - ref: graphql.error.schema_coordinate
        requirement_level:
          conditionally_required: Should be included when the error can be associated with a particular field in the GraphQL schema.
