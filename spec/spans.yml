    type: span
    stability: development
    span_kind: server
    brief: >
      This span represents an incoming GraphQL operation on a server implementation.
    note: |
      **Span name** SHOULD be of the format `{graphql.operation.type}` provided
      `graphql.operation.type` is available. If `graphql.operation.type` is not available,
      the span SHOULD be named `GraphQL Operation`.

      For persisted operations with a specified operation name, instrumentations MAY provide
      a configuration option to enable a more descriptive span name following
      `{graphql.operation.type} {graphql.operation.name}` format when
      `graphql.operation.name` is available and the operation is successfully identified
      in the document.

      > **Warning**
      > The `graphql.operation.name` value is provided by the client and can have high
      > cardinality. Using it in the GraphQL server span name is NOT RECOMMENDED for
      > ad-hoc operations without careful consideration of cardinality implications.
      > For persisted operations, the cardinality is bounded and using the operation
      > name in the span name is more acceptable.
      >
      > Implementations MUST NOT include the operation name in the span name when
      > the operation was not found or could not be identified in the document.
      > This prevents potential security issues and ensures span names remain meaningful.

      This span represents the time spent coercing variables for a GraphQL request.
    note: |
      **Span name** SHOULD be `GraphQL Variable Coercion`.

      This span covers the variable coercion phase of GraphQL request processing,
      where input variables are coerced and validated according to their types.

      This span represents the execution phase of a GraphQL operation.
    note: |
      **Span name** SHOULD be `GraphQL Operation Execution`.

      This span covers the whole execution part of a GraphQL request,
      including field resolution and result formatting.

      This span represents the execution of a GraphQL field resolver.
    note: |
      **Span name** SHOULD be `{graphql.selection.field.coordinate}`.

      This span covers the execution of an individual field resolver,
      including both synchronous and asynchronous resolvers.
      The span ends when the resolver result is available.

      This span represents the execution of a DataLoader batch operation.
    note: |
      **Span name** SHOULD be `GraphQL DataLoader Batch {dataloader.name}` when
      the DataLoader has a name, otherwise `GraphQL DataLoader Batch`.

      This span covers the batched execution of multiple individual DataLoader
      requests. It represents the time from when the batch is scheduled to
      when all results are available. This span is created when a DataLoader
      batches multiple individual load requests into a single batch operation
      to optimize data access patterns.

      The span SHOULD be a child of the span that initiated the batch loading,
      which is typically a resolver execution span.

      - ref: graphql.dataloader.name
        requirement_level: recommended
