        examples: ["FindBookById", "GetUserProfile"]
        note: >
          This represents the operation name as specified in the GraphQL operation document.
          When the operation name is not provided, this attribute SHOULD be omitted.

        brief: "The hash of the operation document."
        type: string
        stability: development

          ]
        note: >
          The hash algorithm used SHOULD be specified as part of the value (e.g., "sha256:...").
          This can be used for monitoring operation distribution and caching strategies.
      - id: graphql.document.id
        brief: >
          The document identifier for persisted operations.
        type: string
        stability: development
        examples: ["aa3e37c1bf54708e93f12c137afba004"]
        note: >
          This is a hash or identifier of the document provided by the user to identify
          persisted operations. This attribute SHOULD only be set when using persisted operations.
      - id: graphql.selection.name
        brief: "The name of the selection that is being resolved. Either the field name or an alias."
        type: string
        stability: development
        examples: ["newAddress", "bookTitle"]
        note: >
          If the field has an alias, this SHOULD be the alias name. Otherwise, it SHOULD be the field name.
      - id: graphql.selection.path
        brief: "The path of the selection that is being resolved."
        type: string
        stability: development
        examples: ["person[0].address"]
        note: >
          The path represents the location of the field being resolved within the result structure.
          Therefore, if a field is aliased, the path will use the alias name instead of the actual field name.
          
      - id: graphql.selection.field.name
        brief: "The name of the field that is being resolved."
        type: string
        stability: development
        examples: ["address", "name", "id"]
        note: >
          This is always the actual field name as defined in the schema, not an alias.
      - id: graphql.selection.field.parent_type
        brief: "The type that declares the field that is being resolved."
        type: string
        stability: development
        examples: ["Person", "Query", "Mutation"]
        note: >
          This is the GraphQL type name that contains the field definition.
      - id: graphql.selection.field.coordinate
        brief: "The coordinate of the field that is being resolved."
        type: string
        stability: development
        examples: ["Person.address", "Query.findBookById"]
        note: >
          The coordinate follows the format "{ParentType}.{fieldName}" and uniquely
          identifies the field within the GraphQL schema.

        brieg: "The id of the step in the execution plan."

        type: string
        stability: development
        examples: ["UserLoader", "ProductByIdLoader", "CommentsByPostIdLoader"]
        note: >
          This represents the name or identifier of the DataLoader instance.
          When the DataLoader implementation supports naming, this SHOULD be set.
          This helps in identifying specific DataLoader instances in observability.
      - id: graphql.dataloader.batch.size
        brief: "The number of individual requests in the DataLoader batch."
        type: int
        stability: development
        examples: [5, 12, 25]
        note: >
          This represents the total number of individual load requests that were
          batched together in a single batch operation. This includes both cache
          hits and cache misses.
      - id: graphql.dataloader.batch.keys
        brief: "A subset of the keys requested in the DataLoader batch."
        type: string[]
        stability: development
        examples: [["user:1", "user:2", "user:3"], ["post:42", "post:99"]]
        note: >
          This attribute is opt-in and SHOULD NOT be enabled by default, as keys
          may contain sensitive or high-cardinality data. When enabled, implementations
          MAY truncate the list to a configurable maximum number of keys.
          The string representation of each key depends on the DataLoader implementation.
      - id: graphql.dataloader.cache.hit_count
        brief: "The number of requests in the batch that were served from the DataLoader cache."
        type: int
        stability: development
        examples: [0, 3, 10]
        note: >
          This represents the number of individual load requests that were
          resolved from the DataLoader's cache without requiring a fetch.
      - id: graphql.dataloader.cache.miss_count
        brief: "The number of requests in the batch that required fetching."
        type: int
        stability: development
        examples: [2, 5, 12]
        note: >
          This represents the number of individual load requests that were
          not found in the DataLoader's cache and required a fetch operation.
