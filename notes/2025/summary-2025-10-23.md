The team discussed error handling conventions and reviewed pull requests for the main repository, with Pascal proposing a new approach for handling errors that includes using exceptions for non-graphical errors and a custom structure for graphical errors. They explored challenges around schema coordinates and error tracking in GraphQL, particularly focusing on security concerns and implementation complexities, while also discussing metrics and monitoring for GraphQL applications. The conversation ended with plans to review existing meters, explore prior art in other languages and ecosystems, and reconvene in January, with Pascal agreeing to add schema coordinates to the specification.

## Next Steps

- Valentin: Sign the contributor agreement
- Pascal: Reach out to Trask  to invite him to join the January meeting
- Marco: Reach out to Trask as backup in case Pascal forgets
- Pascal or team: Open an issue and tag Trask on GitHub
- Pascal: Talk to Benjie about adding schema coordinates to error reporting
- Pascal: Add schema coordinate field to the error specification pull request
- Pascal: Add schema version/signature identifier to the specification for correlating traces with schema versions
- All participants: Read through existing meters in HTTP and other ecosystems  before the January meeting to inform GraphQL meter discussion
- Pascal: Add parsing duration, validation duration, and variable coercion duration meters to the discussion document for January meeting

## Summary

### Year-End Meeting Agenda Review

The meeting began with Pascal noting that the next meeting would be the last one for the year due to upcoming holidays. Valentin and Marco joined, and Pascal introduced the agenda, which included merging pull requests and reviewing attendees' agreements. Valentin mentioned using his personal email for commits, and Pascal clarified that using The Guild email would ensure acceptance. The meeting's guidelines were reviewed, including the publication of meetings on YouTube and the creation of LLM and AR summaries. Pascal encouraged attendees to volunteer for note-taking, and the conversation ended with a plan to review pull requests and introduce attendees.

### Error Handling Proposal Discussion

The team discussed error handling conventions and a pending pull request for the main repository. Pascal explained his proposal for handling errors, which includes using exceptions for non-graphical errors and a custom structure for graphical errors with properties like error message, location, and extensions code. They agreed to reach out to Trask from Microsoft for input on the proposal before the next meeting in January. Pascal emphasized the importance of supporting both event and log event formats for error reporting, as it would make it easier to collect telemetry data from customers.

### GraphQL Error Handling Implementation

Marco and Pascal discussed the implementation of GraphQL error handling, focusing on how to structure error data in OpenTelemetry. They agreed to use a JSON map for error attributes, which allows for more flexibility while maintaining compatibility with existing querying systems. Valentin mentioned a related project on Hive Console that aims to track error rates across schema coordinates, which could help identify problematic areas in the system.

### Schema Path Security Discussion

Valentin and Pascal discussed the challenges of gathering paths corresponding to specific fields in a schema and the potential security implications of exposing schema coordinates through error messages. They agreed that while exposing type names might not be a significant security risk, it's important to consider the broader implications of error messages. Pascal suggested that error coordinates could be useful for correlation, but noted that this might not always be feasible due to performance issues in JavaScript. Valentin mentioned a potential workaround using UTs to fake sync paths, but acknowledged that there's no perfect solution for this problem yet.

### GraphQL Schema Security and Tracing

The team discussed challenges with schema coordinates and error tracking in GraphQL, particularly around security concerns and implementation complexities. They agreed to add schema coordinates to tracing without exposing them to clients, and Pascal will add this to the specification. The group also explored ways to identify schema versions, with Pascal and Valentin noting that a stable identifier is needed, though the exact implementation remains unclear. Finally, they discussed metrics in GraphQL, with Pascal explaining that due to the single endpoint and arbitrary queries, meaningful metering is limited, and they currently only have one useful metric: tracking active operations.

### GraphQL Metrics and Monitoring Discussion

The team discussed metrics and monitoring for GraphQL applications, focusing on how to handle high cardinality and visualize data effectively. Pascal and Marco explored the benefits and limitations of different approaches, including using root fields instead of individual queries or mutations. They agreed that better schema design could reduce the need for root field metrics, but acknowledged that mutations and complex queries still present challenges. The group decided to review existing meters and explore prior art in other languages and ecosystems before reconvening in January. They also briefly discussed the importance of exemplars for tracing and debugging in GraphQL applications.
